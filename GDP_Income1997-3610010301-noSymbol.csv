2,"A review of subsidies in the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts has determined that several entries in the public accounts should be reclassified as subsidies on production, from subsidies on products. The reclassification has no impact on the estimates of GDP at market prices, or on the overall estimates of subsidies. These changes have been incorporated into the data starting in 2020."
